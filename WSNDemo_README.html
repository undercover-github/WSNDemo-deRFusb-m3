<h1>WSNDemo Application</h1>

<p>The WSNDemo application demonstrates wireless sensor network (WSN) organization and 
sensor data collection from network devices on the central coordinator node. <i>WSN Monitor</i> GUI 
application can be used on the PC to display the network topology and sensor data 
in an easy-to-interpret graphical form.</p>

<p>Network start procedure is initiated automatically after device power up. The coordinator organizes the wireless network according to settings
in a configuration file while router and end device nodes try to join the network with specified parameters. One LED is periodically blinking with 
500ms interval while device is joining the network. Once the device enters the network the LED stops blinking and
becomes constantly ON while the node is in the network and awake.</p>

<p>After joining the network each node starts sending data packets containing node information and sensor
measurements periodically to the coordinator. Wireless transmission is indicated by flashing a special LED. The coordinator receives data frames
(indicated by the third LED) and forwards them to PC via USART interface. It also periodically sends own sensor data directly to the serial port.</p>

<p>To observe WSN activities WSN Monitor GUI application should be started on the PC the coordinator is connected to. 
This is a PC-based GUI diagnostic application for WSNDemo that displays the network topology and
other network information. WSN Monitor application is located at <tt>Evaluation tools</tt> folder.

<p>WSN Monitor displays the network topology in 
real time and updates it automatically as nodes join or leave. The 
nodes are represented by icons with the node data tips. The links between the nodes 
are tipped with the link quality data. Sensor data for each node is recorded 
and may be visualized in graphical and table formats.</p>

<p>For detailed information please refer either to <i>BitCloud API Reference</i> or <i>BitCloud Quick Start Guide</i>, which contains detailed
installation and device programming instructions for each supported platform.</p>
